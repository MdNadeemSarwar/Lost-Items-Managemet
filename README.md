Lost Items Managemet
The implementation of lost and found software for universities is necessary in order to save time in the management of lost and found item inventory and in matching up these items with their rightful owners for return. It alleviates the need for maintaining a hand-written or computer-generated inventory list which must be updated constantly and individually checked each time someone calls the school asking after a particular item that may or may not have been left behind. The app makes it very easy to search for items from the palm of your hand, with any online device. Easy and convenient for everyone. And it gives you time to come up with a good explanation for that human skeleton youâ€™ll be bringing home!
